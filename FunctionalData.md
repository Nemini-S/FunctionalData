Functional data analysis (FDA) deals with data that ["provides
information about curves, surfaces or anything else varying over a
continuum."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_data_analysis)
This task view tries to provide an overview of available packages in this developing
field.  
In practice, there is substantial overlap between time series data and functional data,
so many packages listed under the `r view("TimeSeries")` task view
could be useful for functional data as well and vice versa.

### General functional data analysis

The packages listed below provide "infrastructure" for representing and handling
function-valued data and/or implement many widely applicable functional
data methods:

-   `r pkg("fda", priority = "core")` provides object-types for functional data 
    with corresponding functions for smoothing, plotting and simple regression models,
    c.f. Ramsay et al. (2009, `r doi("10.1007/978-0-387-98185-7")`).
-   `r pkg("fdapace", priority = "core")` provides functional
    principal component based methods for sparsely or densely sampled
    random trajectories and time courses for functional regression and
    correlation, for longitudinal data analysis, the analysis of
    stochastic processes from samples of realized trajectories, and for
    the analysis of underlying dynamics.
-   `r pkg("fdasrvf")` performs alignment, PCA, and
    regression of multidimensional or unidimensional functions using the
    square-root velocity framework (Srivastava et al., 2011). This
    framework allows for elastic analysis of functional data through
    phase and amplitude separation.
-   `r pkg("fda.usc", priority = "core")` provides routines
    for exploratory and descriptive analysis of functional data such as
    depth measurements, outlier detection, as well as unsupervised and
    supervised classification, (univariate, nonparametric) regression
    models with a functional covariate and functional analysis of
    variance.
-   `r pkg("fds", priority = "core")` contains 19 data sets
    with functional data.
-   `r pkg("funData")` provides S4 classes for univariate
    and multivariate functional and image data and utility functions.
-   `r pkg("tf", priority = "core")` provides S3 vector data types for functional data with arithmetic and summary methods, derivation, integration and smoothing, plotting, data import and export, and data wrangling (subsetting, sub-assigning, zooming, extracting functional features) that allow including such vectors in data frames for joint analysis of functional and scalar variables.

### Inference methods for functional data

**General purpose regression and classification:**

-   `r pkg("FDboost", priority = "core")` implements flexible
    additive regression models and variable selection for
    scalar-on-function, function-on-scalar and function-on-function
    regression models that are fitted by a component-wise gradient
    boosting algorithm.
-   `r pkg("mlr3fda")` extends ['mlr3'](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) for functional data analysis, with support for irregular and regular functional data as defined in ['tf'](https://tidyfun.github.io/tf/), providing 'PipeOps' for preprocessing functional columns and for extracting scalar features to be used in standard machine learning algorithms.
-   `r pkg("refund", priority = "core")` provides
    spline-based methods for penalized function-on-scalar,
    scalar-on-function, and function-on-function regression as well as
    methods for functional PCA. Some of the functions are also applicable to
    image data.
-   `r pkg("dbstats")` provides prediction methods where
    explanatory information is coded as a matrix of distances between
    individuals. It includes distance based versions of
    `lm` and `glm`, as well as nonparametric versions of both, based on local estimation.
    To apply these methods to functional data it is sufficient to
    calculate a distance matrix between the observed functional data.

-   `r pkg("growfunctions")` estimates a collection of
    time-indexed functions under either of Gaussian process (GP) or
    intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field (iGMRF) prior formulations

    functions to share the same covariance or precision parameters. 
-   `r pkg("multifamm")` implements multivariate functional additive mixed models
    (multiFAMM) based on univariate sparse functional regression models and 
    multivariate functional principal component analysis, c.f.
